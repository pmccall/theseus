	Abstract = {The cortex is a thin, crosslinked actin network lying immediately beneath the plasma membrane of animal cells. Myosin motors exert contractile forces in the meshwork. Because the cortex is attached to the cell membrane, it plays a central role in cell shape control. The proteic constituents of the cortex undergo rapid turnover, making the cortex both mechanically rigid and highly plastic, two properties essential to its function. The cortex has recently attracted increasing attention and its functions in cellular processes such as cytokinesis, cell migration, and embryogenesis are progressively being dissected. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the structural organization, composition, and mechanics of the actin cortex, focusing on the link between molecular processes and macroscopic physical properties. We also highlight consequences of cortex dysfunction in disease. },

	Abstract = {Self-assembly of complex structures is commonplace in biology but often poorly understood. In the case of the actin cytoskeleton, a great deal is known about the components that include higher order structures, such as lamellar meshes, filopodial bundles, and stress fibers. Each of these cytoskeletal structures contains actin filaments and cross-linking proteins, but the role of cross-linking proteins in the initial steps of structure formation has not been clearly elucidated. We employ an optical trapping assay to investigate the behaviors of two actin cross-linking proteins, fascin and α-actinin, during the first steps of structure assembly. Here, we show that these proteins have distinct binding characteristics that cause them to recognize and cross-link filaments that are arranged with specific geometries. α-Actinin is a promiscuous cross-linker, linking filaments over all angles. It retains this flexibility after cross-links are formed, maintaining a connection even when the link is rotated. Conversely, fascin is extremely selective, only cross-linking filaments in a parallel orientation. Surprisingly, bundles formed by either protein are extremely stable, persisting for over 0.5 h in a continuous wash. However, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence decay experiments, we find that the stable fascin population can be rapidly competed away by free fascin. We present a simple avidity model for this cross-link dissociation behavior. Together, these results place constraints on how cytoskeletal structures assemble, organize, and disassemble in vivo.},

@article{Kolahi20081075,
	Abstract = {Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is integral to cell shape and function. Actin-binding proteins, e.g., filamin, can naturally contribute to the mechanics and function of the actin cytoskeleton. The molecular mechanical bases for filamin's function in actin cytoskeletal reorganization are examined here using molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations are performed by applying forces ranging from 25&#xa0;pN to 125&#xa0;pN for 2.5&#xa0;ns to the rod domain of filamin. Applying small loads (∼25&#xa0;pN) to filamin's rod domain supplies sufficient energy to alter the conformation of the N-terminal regions of the rod. These forces break local hydrogen bond coordination often enough to allow side chains to find new coordination partners, in turn leading to drastic changes in the conformation of filamin, for example, increasing the hydrophobic character of the N-terminal rod region and, alternatively, activating the C-terminal region to become increasingly stiff. These changes in conformation can lead to changes in the affinity of filamin for its binding partners. Therefore, filamin can function to transduce mechanical signals as well as preserve topology of the actin cytoskeleton throughout the rod domain. },

	Abstract = {Load dependence of the lifetime of the rigor bonds formed between a single myosin molecule (either heavy meromyosin, HMM, or myosin subfragment-1, S1) and actin filament was examined in the absence of nucleotide by pulling the barbed end of the actin filament with optical tweezers. For S1, the relationship between the lifetime (τ) and the externally imposed load (F) at absolute temperature T could be expressed as τ(F)&#xa0;=&#xa0;τ(0)·exp(−F·d/kBT) with τ(0) of 67&#xa0;s and an apparent interaction distance d of 2.4&#xa0;nm (kB is the Boltzmann constant). The relationship for \{HMM\} was expressed by the sum of two exponentials, with two sets of τ(0) and d being, respectively, 62&#xa0;s and 2.7&#xa0;nm, and 950&#xa0;s and 1.4&#xa0;nm. The fast component of \{HMM\} coincides with τ(F) for S1, suggesting that the fast component corresponds to single-headed binding and the slow component to double-headed binding. These large interaction distances, which may be a common characteristic of motor proteins, are attributed to the geometry for applying an external load. The pulling experiment has also allowed direct estimation of the number of myosin molecules interacting with an actin filament. Actin filaments tethered to a single \{HMM\} molecule underwent extensive rotational Brownian motion, indicating a low torsional stiffness for HMM. From these results, we discuss the characteristics of interaction between actin and myosin, with the focus on the manner of binding of myosin. },

@article{Liu20022705,
	Abstract = {In this report we characterized the longitudinal elasticity of single actin filaments manipulated by novel silicon-nitride microfabricated levers. Single actin filaments were stretched from zero tension to maximal physiological tension, P0. The obtained length-tension relation was nonlinear in the low-tension range (0--50 pN) with a resultant strain of ∼0.4--0.6% and then became linear at moderate to high tensions (∼50--230 pN). In this region, the stretching stiffness of a single rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled, 1-μm-long F-actin is 34.5&#xa0;$\pm$&#xa0;3.5 pN/nm. Such a length-tension relation could be characterized by an entropic-enthalpic worm-like chain model, which ascribes most of the energy consumed in the nonlinear portion to overcoming thermal undulations arising from the filament's interaction with surrounding solution and the linear portion to the intrinsic stretching elasticity. By fitting the experimental data with such a worm-like chain model, an estimation of persistence length of ∼8.75&#xa0;μm was derived. These results suggest that F-actin is more compliant than previously thought and that thin filament compliance may account for a substantial fraction of the sarcomere's elasticity. },

@article{Liu1998153,
	Abstract = {Numerical simulation is used to investigate the flow of polymer solutions around a periodic, linear array of cylinders by using three constitutive equations derived from kinetic theory of dilute polymer solutions: the Giesekus model; the finitely extensible, nonlinear elastic dumbbell model with Peterlin's approximation (FENE-P); and the \{FENE\} dumbbell model of Chilcott--Rallison (CR). In the Giesekus model, intramolecular forces are described by a Hookean spring, whereas a finitely extensible spring whose modulus is given by the Warner approximation is used in both the FENE-P and \{CR\} models. Hydro dynamic drag on the beads is taken to be anisotropic for the Giesekus model and isotropic for the other two models. The \{CR\} and FENE-P models differ subtly in their approximate treatment of the nonlinear force law. The three models exhibit very similar rheological behavior in viscometric flow and steady elongational flow, with the notable exception that the viscosity for the \{CR\} model is shear-rate independent. Finite element simulations are performed by using two different formulations: the elastic-viscous split-stress gradient (EVSS-G) method and a new variant of this formulation, the discrete EVSS-G (DEVSS-G) formulation, in which the elliptic stabilization term is added only to the discrete version of the momentum equation, and the constitutive equation is solved directly in terms of the polymer contribution to the stress tensor. Calculations are performed for all models up to a Weissenberg number We, where the configuration tensor 〈QQ〉 loses positive definiteness. However, by locally refining the mesh in the gap region, the positive definiteness of 〈QQ〉 is recovered. The flow and stress fields predicted by the three constitutive equations are qualitatively similar. A `birefringent strand' of highly stretched polymer molecules, which appears to emanate from the rear stagnation point in the cylinder, strengthens as We is increased. Not surprisingly, the molecular extension computed for the Giesekus model is considerably larger than that of the two \{FENE\} spring models. The drag force on the cylinders differs for the FENE-P and \{CR\} models, because of the difference in the shear-thinning viscosity resulting from the different approximations used in these models. },

	Abstract = {The mechanics of biological tissue is largely determined by the mechanics of biopolymer networks such as the extracellular matrix on cellular scale or the cytoskeleton on subcellular scale. Micromechanical simulations of biopolymer networks have thus attracted increasing interest in the last years. Here we introduce a simulation framework for biopolymer networks based on a finite element model of the filaments with a backward Euler time integration scheme. This approach surpasses previously published ones, especially those based on bead-spring models, by its sound theoretical foundation, a great flexibility, and at the same time an efficiency gain of approximately two orders of magnitude. Thereby it allows for addressing problems no previous numerical method could deal with, e.g., the micromechanical analysis of the viscoelastic moduli of crosslinked biopolymer networks in the low frequency regime or the analysis of the thermal equilibrium phases of such networks. By means of several examples it is discussed how this capacity can be exploited in multiscale simulations of biological tissue on cellular and subcellular scale. },

	Abstract = {The actin cross-linker α-actinin-4 has been found to be indispensable for the structural and functional integrity of podocytes; deficiency or alteration of this protein due to mutations results in kidney disease. To gain insight into the effect of the cross-linker on cytoskeletal mechanics, we studied the macroscopic rheological properties of actin networks cross-linked with wild-type and mutant α-actinin-4. The frequency-dependent viscoelasticity of the networks is characterized by an elastic plateau at intermediate frequencies, and relaxation toward fluid properties at low frequencies. The relaxation frequencies of networks with mutant α-actinin-4 are an order of magnitude lower than that with the wild-type, suggesting a slower reaction rate for the dissociation of actin and α-actinin for the mutant, consistent with a smaller observed equilibrium dissociation constant. This difference can be attributed to an additional binding site that is exposed as a result of the mutation, and can be interpreted as a difference in binding energy barriers. This is further supported by the Arrhenius-like temperature dependence of the relaxation frequencies. },

	Abstract = {Networks of cross-linked and bundled actin filaments are ubiquitous in the cellular cytoskeleton, but their elasticity remains poorly understood. We show that these networks exhibit exceptional elastic behavior that reflects the mechanical properties of individual filaments. There are two distinct regimes of elasticity, one reflectingbendingof single filaments and a second reflectingstretchingof entropic fluctuations of filament length. The mechanical stiffness can vary by several decades with small changes in cross-link concentration, and can increase markedly upon application of external stress. We parameterize the full range of behavior in a state diagram and elucidate its origin with a robust model.},

	Abstract = { Linear rheological properties of tightly-entangled isotropic solutions of semi-flexible polymers are calculated using a tube model, and qualitative predictions are given for the response of more dilute solutions. The linear complex modulus of a solution of long, tightly-entangled chains is dominated at low frequencies by a curvature contribution, analogous to the elastic stress of entangled flexible chains, that relaxes by reptation and gives rise to a broad elastic plateau. The modulus is dominated at higher frequencies by a larger tension contribution, whose frequency dependence is controlled at intermediate frequencies by the diffusion of excess length along the tube and at very high frequencies by the unhindered transverse motion of the chain within the tube. This high-frequency regime yields a complex modulus that varies as G*(ω) ∝ (iω)3/4 with frequency ω. Solutions of shorter, rod-like chains also exhibit a slowly-decaying orientational contribution analogous to the elastic stress found in solutions of true rigid rods. The linear response of the flow birefringence and the effect of cross-links between chains are also discussed. },

	Abstract = {To evaluate the contributions of cross-linker dynamics and polymer deformation to the frequency-dependent stiffness of actin filament gels, we compared the rheological properties of actin gels with three types of cross-linkers: a weak one, Acanthamoeba alpha-actinin (dissociation rate constant 5.2 s-1, association rate constant 1.1 x 10(6) M-1 s-1); a strong one, chicken smooth muscle alpha-actinin (dissociation rate constant 0.66 s-1, association rate constant 1.20 x 10(6) M-1 s-1); and an extremely strong one, biotin/avidin (dissociation rate constant approximately zero). The biotin/avidin cross-linked gel, whose behavior is determined by polymer bending alone, behaves like a solid and shows no frequency dependence. The amoeba alpha-actinin cross-linked gel behaves like a viscoelastic fluid, and the frequency dependence of the stiffness can be explained by a mathematical model for dynamically cross-linked gels. The stiffness of the chicken alpha-actinin cross-linked gel is independent of frequency, and has viscoelastic properties intermediate between the two. The two alpha-actinins have similar association rate constants for binding to actin filaments, consistent with a diffusion-limited reaction. Rigid cross-links make the gel stiff, but make it elastic without the ability to deform permanently. Dynamically cross-linked actin filaments should allow the cell to react passively to various outside forces without any sort of signaling. Slower, signal-mediated pathways, such as severing filaments or changing the affinity of cross-linkers, could alter the nature of these passive reactions. },

	Abstract = {Although the structure of cross-linking molecules mainly determines the structural organization of actin filaments and with that the static elastic properties of the cytoskeleton, it is largely unknown how the biochemical characteristics of transiently cross-linking proteins (actin-binding proteins (ABPs)) affect the viscoelasticity of actin networks. In this study, we show that the macroscopic network response of reconstituted actin networks can be traced back to the microscopic interaction potential of an individual actin/ABP bond. The viscoelastic response of cross-linked actin networks is set by the cross-linker off-rate, the binding energy, and the characteristic bond length of individual actin/ABP interactions.},

@article{Yao20111062,
	Abstract = {Filamentous actin and associated actin binding proteins play an essential role in governing the mechanical properties of eukaryotic cells. They can also play a critical role in disease; for example, mutations in α-actinin-4 (Actn4), a dynamic actin cross-linking protein, cause proteinuric disease in humans and mice. Amino acid substitutions strongly affect the binding affinity and protein structure of Actn4. To study the physical impact of such substitutions on the underlying cytoskeletal network, we examine the bulk mechanical behavior of in vitro actin networks cross-linked with wild-type and mutant Actn4. These networks exhibit a complex viscoelastic response and are characterized by fluid-like behavior at the longest timescales, a feature that can be quantitatively accounted for through a model governed by dynamic cross-linking. The elastic behavior of the network is highly nonlinear, becoming much stiffer with applied stress. This nonlinear elastic response is also highly sensitive to the mutations of Actn4. In particular, we observe that actin networks cross-linked with Actn4 bearing the disease-causing \{K255E\} mutation are more brittle, with a lower breaking stress in comparison to networks cross-linked with wild-type Actn4. Furthermore, a mutation that ablates the first actin binding site (ABS1) in Actn4 abrogates the network's ability to stress-stiffen is standard nomenclature. These changes in the mechanical properties of actin networks cross-linked with mutant Actn4 may represent physical determinants of the underlying disease mechanism in inherited focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. },

@article{Kim:2011aa,
	Abstract = {We develop a computational model to compare the relative importance of unbinding and unfolding of actin cross-linking proteins (ACPs) in the dynamic properties of the actin cytoskeleton. We show that in the strain-stiffening regime with typical physiological and experimental strain rates, unbinding events are predominant with negligible unfolding. ACPs unbound by greater forces experience larger displacements, with a tendency to rebind to different filaments. At constant strain, stress relaxes to physiological levels by unbinding only---not unfolding---of ACPs, which is consistent with experiments. Also, rebinding of ACPs dampens full relaxation of stress. When the network is allowed to return to a stress-free state after shear deformation, plastic deformation is observed only with unbinding. These results suggest that despite the possibility of unfolding, unbinding of ACPs is the major determinant for the rheology of the actin network.},
