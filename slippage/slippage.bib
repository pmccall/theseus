	Abstract = {Although the structure of cross-linking molecules mainly determines the structural organization of actin filaments and with that the static elastic properties of the cytoskeleton, it is largely unknown how the biochemical characteristics of transiently cross-linking proteins (actin-binding proteins (ABPs)) affect the viscoelasticity of actin networks. In this study, we show that the macroscopic network response of reconstituted actin networks can be traced back to the microscopic interaction potential of an individual actin/ABP bond. The viscoelastic response of cross-linked actin networks is set by the cross-linker off-rate, the binding energy, and the characteristic bond length of individual actin/ABP interactions.},

@article{Yao20111062,
	Abstract = {Filamentous actin and associated actin binding proteins play an essential role in governing the mechanical properties of eukaryotic cells. They can also play a critical role in disease; for example, mutations in α-actinin-4 (Actn4), a dynamic actin cross-linking protein, cause proteinuric disease in humans and mice. Amino acid substitutions strongly affect the binding affinity and protein structure of Actn4. To study the physical impact of such substitutions on the underlying cytoskeletal network, we examine the bulk mechanical behavior of in vitro actin networks cross-linked with wild-type and mutant Actn4. These networks exhibit a complex viscoelastic response and are characterized by fluid-like behavior at the longest timescales, a feature that can be quantitatively accounted for through a model governed by dynamic cross-linking. The elastic behavior of the network is highly nonlinear, becoming much stiffer with applied stress. This nonlinear elastic response is also highly sensitive to the mutations of Actn4. In particular, we observe that actin networks cross-linked with Actn4 bearing the disease-causing \{K255E\} mutation are more brittle, with a lower breaking stress in comparison to networks cross-linked with wild-type Actn4. Furthermore, a mutation that ablates the first actin binding site (ABS1) in Actn4 abrogates the network's ability to stress-stiffen is standard nomenclature. These changes in the mechanical properties of actin networks cross-linked with mutant Actn4 may represent physical determinants of the underlying disease mechanism in inherited focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. },

@article{Kim:2011aa,
	Abstract = {We develop a computational model to compare the relative importance of unbinding and unfolding of actin cross-linking proteins (ACPs) in the dynamic properties of the actin cytoskeleton. We show that in the strain-stiffening regime with typical physiological and experimental strain rates, unbinding events are predominant with negligible unfolding. ACPs unbound by greater forces experience larger displacements, with a tendency to rebind to different filaments. At constant strain, stress relaxes to physiological levels by unbinding only---not unfolding---of ACPs, which is consistent with experiments. Also, rebinding of ACPs dampens full relaxation of stress. When the network is allowed to return to a stress-free state after shear deformation, plastic deformation is observed only with unbinding. These results suggest that despite the possibility of unfolding, unbinding of ACPs is the major determinant for the rheology of the actin network.},

@article{C2SM25508A,
	Abstract = {Slide-ring (SR) gels are polymer networks with movable cross-links that are prepared by cross-linking polyrotaxane (PR) in which many cyclic molecules are threaded into a linear polymer chain. The elastic modulus E of SR gels shows a unique dependence on cross-linking density: at a high cross-linking density{,} E decreases with increasing cross-linking density. This tendency is not in agreement with conventional rubber elasticity theory. In order to explain this abnormal dependence{,} we propose a novel molecular theory for SR gels{,} which considers the alignment entropy of cyclic molecules on polymer networks. The alignment yields new entropic elasticity of the slidable network in SR gels.},
