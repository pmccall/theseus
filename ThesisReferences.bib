	Abstract = {The mechanical properties of cells are dominated by the cytoskeleton, a crosslinked network of protein filaments. Unlike synthetic polymer networks, the cell cytoskeleton is a highly dynamical system due to the on-off kinetics of the crosslinking proteins and the polymerization--depolymerization cycles of the filaments themselves. More remarkably, some of the crosslinkers are motor proteins, which are capable of generating forces and directional motion between the filaments by consuming chemical energy. Thus, the cell cytoskeleton is a highly complex and active polymer gel, which is responsible for the unique cell mechanical properties, which make it crawl, divide and assemble to higher functional units. This complexity of the cytoskeleton demands the development of novel experimental techniques as well as theoretical ideas. This review will deal with the recent technological, experimental and theoretical developments in the field of cell mechanics, and current trends. It will be shown that despite the cytoskeletal complexity, cells show some very general rheological properties. },

	Abstract = {Cells both actively generate and sensitively react to forces through their mechanical framework, the cytoskeleton, which is a nonequilibrium composite material including polymers and motor proteins. We measured the dynamics and mechanical properties of a simple three-component model system consisting of myosin II, actin filaments, and cross-linkers. In this system, stresses arising from motor activity controlled the cytoskeletal network mechanics, increasing stiffness by a factor of nearly 100 and qualitatively changing the viscoelastic response of the network in an adenosine triphosphate--dependent manner. We present a quantitative theoretical model connecting the large-scale properties of this active gel to molecular force generation.},

	Abstract = { Active particles contain internal degrees of freedom with the ability to take in and dissipate energy and, in the process, execute systematic movement. Examples include all living organisms and their motile constituents such as molecular motors. This article reviews recent progress in applying the principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics to form a systematic theory of the behavior of collections of active particles--active matter--with only minimal regard to microscopic details. A unified view of the many kinds of active matter is presented, encompassing not only living systems but inanimate analogs. Theory and experiment are discussed side by side. },

@article{Kim2014526,
	Abstract = {Abstract The actin cortex has a well-documented ability to rapidly remodel and flow while maintaining long-range connectivity, but how this is achieved remains poorly understood. Here, we use computer simulations to explore how stress relaxation in cross-linked actin networks subjected to extensional stress depends on the interplay between network architecture and turnover. We characterize a regime in which a network response is nonaffine and stress relaxation is governed by the continuous dissipation of elastic energy via cyclic formation, elongation, and turnover of tension-bearing elements. Within this regime, for a wide range of network parameters, we observe a constant deformation (creep) rate that is linearly proportional to the rate of filament turnover, leading to a constant effective viscosity that is inversely proportional to turnover rate. Significantly, we observe a biphasic dependence of the creep rate on applied stress: below a critical stress threshold, the creep rate increases linearly with applied stress; above that threshold, the creep rate becomes independent of applied stress. We show that this biphasic stress dependence can be understood in terms of the nonlinear force-extension behavior of individual force-transmitting network elements. These results have important implications for understanding the origins and control of viscous flows both in the cortex of living cells and in other polymer networks. },

We show that these networks exhibit exceptional elastic behavior that reflects the mechanical properties of individual filaments.

The mechanical stiffness can vary by several decades with small changes in cross-link concentration, and can increase markedly upon application of external stress.
