	Abstract = {<p>We present a physical analysis of the dynamics and mechanics of contractile actin rings. In particular, we analyze the dynamics of ring contraction during cytokinesis in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryo. We present a general analysis of force balances and material exchange and estimate the relevant parameter values. We show that on a microscopic level contractile stresses can result from both the action of motor proteins, which cross-link filaments, and from the polymerization and depolymerization of filaments in the presence of end-tracking cross-linkers.</p>},

@article{McGrath:2000aa,
	Abstract = {Cycling of actin subunits between monomeric and filamentous phases is essential for cell crawling behavior. We investigated actin filament turnover rates, length, number, barbed end exposure, and binding of cofilin in bovine arterial endothelial cells moving at different speeds depending on their position in a confluent monolayer. Fast-translocating cells near the wound edge have short filament lifetimes compared with turnover values that proportionately increase in slower moving cells situated at increasing distances from the wound border. Contrasted with slow cells exhibiting slow actin filament turnover speeds, fast cells have less polymerized actin, shorter actin filaments, more free barbed ends, and less actin-associated cofilin. Cultured primary fibroblasts manifest identical relationships between speed and actin turnover as the endothelial cells, and fast fibroblasts expressing gelsolin have higher actin turnover rates than slow fibroblasts that lack this actin-severing protein. These results implicate actin filament severing as an important control mechanism for actin cycling in cells.},
