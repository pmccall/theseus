\section*{Author Summary}
In this paper, we develop and analyze a minimal model for 2D active networks based on the cortical cytoskeleton of eukaryotic embryos.  Our model introduces a drag-like slip between cross-linked filaments as means to dissipate stored stress, generating a macroscopic effective viscosity.  We further introduce an active friction to active stress from microscopic properties.  We generate computational simulations based on the model, and demonstrate that active stress is sufficient to drive network contraction only temporarily.  By introducing filament recycling, we are able to set up steady state flow profiles such as those found in the cortex of developing embryos and migrating cells.  The model is used to calculate phenomenological constants measured in prior experiments.  Our analysis sheds insight on potential microscopic control parameters governing broad qualitative differences in 2D active networks.  We make our model freely accessible and our methodology transparent to enable other researchers to clearly understand our modeling framework and to build upon our findings.

\section*{Introduction}

\paragraph{}  Cortical flow is a fundamental and ubiquitous form of cellular deformation that underlies cell polarization, cell division, cell crawling and multicellular tissue morphogenesis\cite{cellmech_flows3,cellmech_flows2}.  These flows arise within the actomyosin cortex, a thin layer of cross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors that lies just beneath the plasma membrane \cite{Salbreux2012536}. The active forces that drive cortical flows are thought to be generated by myosin motors pulling against individual actin filaments \cite{Munro2004413}. These forces must be integrated within cross-linked networks to build macroscopic contractile stress.  At the same time, cross-linked networks resist deformation and this resistance must be dissipated by network remodeling to allow macroscopic network deformation and flow.  How force production and dissipation depend on motor activity, network architecture and remodeling remains poorly understood.

Current models for cortical flow rely on coarse-grained descriptions of actomyosin networks as active fluids, whose motions are driven by gradients of active contractile stress and opposed by an effectively viscous resistance\cite{cellmech_flows}.  In these models, gradients of active stress are assumed to reflect spatial variation in motor activity and viscous resistance is assumed to reflect the internal dissipation of elastic resistance due to local remodeling of filaments and/or crosslinks \cite{PhysRevLett.106.028103}.  A key virtue of these models is that their behavior is governed by a few parameters (active stress and effective viscosity).  By coupling an active fluid description to simple kinetic models for network assembly and disassembly and making active stress and effective viscosity depend on e.g network density and turnover rates, it is possible to capture phenomenological descriptions of cortical flow.  Models based on this active fluids description can successfully reproduce spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical flow observed during polarization \cite{cellmech_flows}, cell division \cite{Turlier2014114,PhysRevLett.103.058102}, cell motility \cite{Keren:2009aa,RevModPhys.85.1143} and tissue morphogenesis \cite{Heisenberg2013948}.  

However, to understand how cells exert physiological control over cortical deformation and flow, or to build and tune networks with desired properties {\em in vitro}, it is essential to connect this coarse-grained description to the microscopic origins of force generation and dissipation within cross-linked actomyosin networks.  Both active stress and effective viscosity depend sensitively on microscopic parameters including densities of filaments, motors and cross-links, force-dependent motor/filament interactions, cross-link dynamics and network turnover rates.  Thus a key challenge is to understand how tuning these microscopic parameters controls the dynamic interplay between active force generation and passive relaxation to control macroscopic dynamics of cortical flow.

\paragraph{} Studies in living cells have documented fluid-like stress relaxation on timescales of 10-100s of seconds \cite{cellmech_flows,cellmech_flows2,cellmech_flows3,rheo_fluid,rheo_fluid2,cell_rheo_exp}.  These modes of stress relaxation are thought to arise both from the transient binding/unbinding of individual cross-links and from the turnover (assembly/disassembly) of actin filaments (ref).  Studies of cross-linked and/or bundled actin networks {\em in vitro} suggest that cross-link unbinding may be sufficient to support viscous relaxation (creep) on very long timescales\cite{rheo_crosslinksmatter,rheo_crosslinkslip1,rheo_crosslinkslip2,rheo_crosslinkslip3,rheo_nonaffine}, but is unlikely to explain the rapid large scale cortical deformation and flow observed in living cells.  suggest that rapid actin turnover must play a significant role as well. Indeed, photokinetic and single molecule imaging studies studies reveal rapid turnover of cortical actin filaments in living cells on timescales of 10-100 seconds \cite{Robin:2014aa}. Previous theoretical models have explored  the dependence of stress relaxation on cross-link binding and unbinding analytically \cite{theo_crosslinkslip1,theo_crosslinkslip2} and others have explicitly modeled reversible cross-linking in combination with complex mechanics of filament bundles \cite{model_taeyoon,rheo_crosslinkslip2,theo_crosslinkslip3}.  However, until very recently \cite{Mak:2016aa} very little attention has been paid to actin turnover as mechanism of stress relaxation. 

Recent work has also begun to reveal insights into mechanisms that govern active stress generation in disordered actomyosin networks. In vitro studies have confirmed that local interactions among actin filaments and myosin motors are sufficient to drive macroscopic contraction of disordered networks \cite{rheo_2D1}.  Theoretical studies suggest that asymmetrical compliance of actin filaments (stiffer under extension than compression) and spatial differences (dispersion) in motor activity are sufficient conditions for contraction in one \cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037} and two \cite{PhysRevX.4.041002} dimensional networks, although other routes to contractility may also exist \cite{PhysRevX.4.041002}.  Further work has explored how modulation of network architecture, crosslink dynamics and motor density, activity and assembly state can shape rates and patterns of network deformation \cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0039869,Alvarado:2013aa,C0SM00494D} or network rheology \cite{0295-5075-85-1-18007,rheo_active}.  

Significantly, {\em in vitro} models for disordered actomyosin networks have used stable actin filaments, and these networks  support only transient contraction, either because of network collapse (ref), or buildup of elastic resistance (ref?), or because network rearrangements (polarity sorting) dissipate the potential to generate contractile force (ref). This suggest that continuous turnover of actin filaments may play a key role in allowing sustained deformation and flow (refs). Recent theoretical and modeling studies have begun to explore how this could work \cite{2015arXiv150706182H,Mak:2016aa,10.1371/journal.pone.0000696}, and to explore dynamic behaviors that can emerge in contractile material with turnover \cite{PhysRevLett.113.148102}. However, there is much to learn about how the buildup and maintenance of contractile force during continuous deformation and flow depends local interplay of network architecture, motor activity and filament turnover.

\paragraph{}  The goal of this work was to build a computational bridge between the microscopic description of cross-linked actomyosin networks and the coarse grained macroscopic description of an active fluid.  We sought to capture the essential microscope features (dynamic cross-links, active motors and semi flexible actin filaments with asymmetric compliance and continuous filament recycling), but in a way that is sufficiently simple to allow systematic exploration of how parameters that govern network deformation and flow in an active fluid theory depend on microscopic parameters. To this end, we introduce several coarse-grained approximations into our representation of filament networks. First, we represent semi-flexible actin filaments as chains of simple springs with asymmetric compliance (stronger in extension than compression). Second, we replace  dynamic binding/unbinding of elastic cross-links with a coarse-grained representation in terms of molecular friction \cite{theo_friction,theo_frictionSam,theo_molefric}, such that filaments can slide past each other against a constant fictional resistance. Third, we used a similar scheme to introduce active motors at filament crossover points with a simple linear force/velocity relationship, and we introduce ?dispersion? of motor activity by making only a subset of filament overlaps active \cite{theo_frictionShila}.  Finally, we model filament turnover by regularly reseting a subset of filaments to a new unstrained position. Importantly, these simplification allows us to extend our single polymer models to dynamical systems of larger network models for direct comparison between theory and modeling results. This level of coarse graining will therefore make it easier to understand classes of behavior for varying compositions of cross-linked filament networks. In addition, it allows us to compute a new class of numerical simulations efficiently, which gives us concrete predictions for behaviors in widely different networks with measurable dependencies on molecular details.

We choose to focus our attention on 2D networks both for their tractability as well as their relevance in the quasi-2D cytoskeletal cortex of many eukaryotic cells\cite{cellmech_flows}.  In addition, recent developments in 2D {\em in vitro} systems\cite{rheo_2D1,rheo_2D2}, make 2D disordered models all the more interesting as a renewed focus of study.  In the rest of this section, we underline the key points necessary for understanding our modeling framework and the key assumptions we have made in generating our equations of motion for the system.


\subsection*{Asymmetric Filament Compliance}
We model individual filaments as chains of springs with relaxed length $l_s$.  Filaments can therefore be represented as a sequence of nodes with positions $\mathbf{x_i}$ and nearest neighbor force interactions, $\mathbf{F^{\mu}_i}$, of the form

\begin{equation}
|F^{\mu}_i| = \mu\cdot\frac{|\mathbf{x_{i+1}}-\mathbf{x_i}|-l_s}{l_s} +\mu\cdot\frac{|\mathbf{x_{i-1}}-\mathbf{x_i}|-l_s}{l_s}
\end{equation}





where, $\mu$ represents an extensional modulus of a filament.   Here, we take the modulus, $\mu$, to have a different value depending on whether $|\mathbf{x_{i-1}}-\mathbf{x_i}|-l_s$ is greater or less than 0.  This moduli is a composite quantity related to both filament and cross-linker compliance in a manner similar to a proposed effective medium theory\cite{theo_crosslinknonlinear}.  In the limit of highly rigid cross-links and flexible filaments, our model reduces to the pure semi-flexible filament models of \cite{theo_hlm,theo_hlm2}.  In the opposite regime of nearly rigid filaments and highly flexible cross links, our method is still largely similar to the model of \cite{theo_crosslinknonlinear} in small strain regimes before any nonlinear cross link stiffening.  However, in departure from those models, the magnitude of the force on interior cross-links in our model is still the same as those on the exterior.  This is a simplification of the varying levels of strain that would actually be present in these cross-linkers as addressed in \cite{theo_crosslinknonlinear}, but we choose to ignore the slight variation in favor of an approximated, global mean approach.  



\subsection*{Drag-like Coupling Between Overlapping Filaments}
\label{exp_drag}
Cross-link binding and unbinding is an important element of the overall stress relaxation of a network.  In contrast to previous models, we allow relaxation of the network's stored stress by letting the attachment points slip.  We do this by replacing an elastic interaction between pairs of points along filament segments with a drag-like coupling between segments.
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F^{\xi}_i} = \xi \cdot \int^{s_{i+1}}_{s_{i-1}} ds \frac{l_s-|s-s_i|}{l_s} \: (\mathbf{v_i}-\mathbf{v_j}) \: p_{ij}(s)
\end{equation}

Where $p_{ij}(s)$ represents the locational distribution of cross-link points (equal to 1 at locations of cross-links and 0 elsewhere) and $\mathbf{v_i}$ and $\mathbf{v_j}$ represent the the velocities of the $i$th and $j$th filament segment.  This model assumes a linear relation between applied force and the velocity difference between attached segments.  This drag-like coupling has been shown to be an adequate approximation in the case of ionic cross-linking of actin\cite{mol_fric,theo_hydroish2}, and can be found in the theoretical basis of force-velocity curves for myosin bound filaments\cite{theo_frictionShila}. Although non-linearities can arise through force dependent detachment kinetics and/or non-linear force extension of cross-links, we assume that inhomogeneities from non-linear effects are of second or higher order. With this assumption, the motion for the entire network is governed by a dynamical equation of the form

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:syst}
L\zeta\mathbf{ v_i} +\mathbf{F^{\xi}_i}= \mathbf{F^{\mu}_i}
\end{equation}

Here, the first term in the integral is the filament's intrinsic drag through its embedding fluid, $\zeta$, while the second comes from the drag-like coupling between filaments, $\xi$.  

\subsection*{Active Coupling for Motor Driven Filament Interactions}

To add motor activity we select a subset of cross-linked points and impart an additional force of magnitude $\upsilon$ directed in the orientations of the individual filaments, $\mathbf{u_i}$.  This leads to a modification of the equation of motion to

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:syst}
\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_i}= \mathbf{\hat{u}_i}\cdot\upsilon\int ds \sum _j \:  \frac{l_s-|s-s_i|}{l_s} p_{ij}q_{ij}
\end{equation}



In this formulation, only at the subset of points where  $p_{ij}=1$ and $q_{ij}=1$ will there be a force imparted.  In our simulations we let $q_{ij}$ be selected randomly such that $\bar{q}=\phi$, where $\bar{q}$ indicates the mean of $q$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:syst}
L\zeta\mathbf{ v_i} +\mathbf{F^{\xi}_i}= \mathbf{F^{\mu}_i}+\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_i}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{2D Network Formation}

We follow a mikado model approach by initializing a minimal network of connected unstressed linear filaments in a rectangular 2D domain.  We generate 2D networks of these semi-flexible filaments by laying down straight lines of length, $L$, with random position and orientation. We then assume that some fixed fraction of overlapping filaments become cross-linked (defined in \ref{exp_drag}) at their point of overlap.

Although real cytoskeletal networks may form with non-negligible anisotropy,  we  focus on isotropically initialized networks for simplicity.  We define the density using the average distance between cross-links along a filament, $l_c$. A simple geometrical argument can then be used to derive the number of filaments filling a domain as a function of $L$ and $l_c$\cite{theo_hlm}.  Here, we use the approximation that the number of filaments needed to tile a rectangular domain of size $W \times H$  is $2WH/Ll_c$, and that the length density is therefore $1/l_c$. In the absence of cross-link slip, we expect the network to form a connected solid with a well defined elastic modulus\cite{theo_hlm,theo_hlm2}.  


\subsection*{System of Equations for Applied Stress}
We model our full network as a coupled system of differential equations satisfying \ref{eqn:syst}.  Although the general mechanical response of this system may be very complex, we focus our attention on low frequency deformations and the steady-state creep response of the system to an applied stress.  To do this we introduce a fixed stress, $\sigma$ along the midline of our domain.  This stress points in the direction, $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$, producing extensional stress.

Finally, we add a 0 velocity constraint at the far edges of our domain of interest.  We assume that our network is in the "dry," low Reynold's number limit, where inertial effects are so small that we can equate our total force to 0.  Therefore, we have a dynamical system of wormlike chain filaments satisfying

\begin{equation}
L\zeta\mathbf{ v_i} +\mathbf{F^{\xi}_i(v_i)}= \mathbf{F^{\mu}_i(x_i)}+\mathbf{F^{\upsilon}_i(x_i)} + \sigma\mathbf{\hat{u}(x_i)}
\end{equation}

subject to constraints such that $\mathbf{v_i(x)}$ is 0 with $x=0$.  This results in an implicit differential equation for filament segments which can be discretized and integrated in time to produce a solution for the motion of the system.


\subsection*{Filament Recycling as a model for rapid filament turnover}

To simplify the complex biochemical changes that can give rise to actin filament polymerization and depolymerization, we chose to use simple filament appearance and disappearance as a lowest order model of filament recycling.  In this sense the average lifetime of a filament between it's appearance and disappearance would be $\tau_r$.  In order to do this without causing an unnecessary bias in the results, at a regularized interval $\tau_s < 0.01\cdot\tau_r$, we selected $\tau_s/\tau_r$ filaments, reset their extension or compression to 0, and relocated them to a random position and orientation.  This has the effect of creating an approximately exponential decay in the number of old filaments over time.


\subsection*{Computational Simulation Method}

We tested our analytical conclusions on a computational model.  More technical details of the model can be found in the Appendix, but we summarize the main modeling points here.

We discretize the filaments such that the equations of motion becomes a coupled system of equations for the velocities of filament endpoints, $\mathbf{x}$.  The drag-like force between overlapping filaments results in a coupling of the velocities of endpoints.  

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A \cdot \dot x} = \mathbf{f(x)}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{A }$ represents a coupling matrix between endpoints of filaments that overlap, and $\mathbf{f(x)}$ is the spring force between pairs of filament segment endpoints.  We can then numerically integrate this system of equations to find the time evolution of the positions of all filament endpoints.

We generate a network by laying down filaments with random position and orientation within a domain of size $D_x$ by $D_y$ with periodic boundaries in the y-dimension.  The external stress (shear or extensional/compressional) is applied to all filament endpoints falling within a fixed x-distance from the center of the domain.  Finally, filament endpoints falling within a fixed x-distance from the edges of the domain are constrained to be nonmoving.  All filament interactions, force fields, and constraints are smoothed over small regions such that the equations will contain no sharp discontinuities.


The nominal units for length, force, and time are $\mu m$, nN, and s, respectively.  We explored parameter space around an estimate of biologically relevant parameter values, given in Table \ref{table:para}.

\section*{Results and Discussion}
We used our model to characterize how rates and patterns of cortical flow are shaped by complex dependencies of active force generation and passive force dissipation on network architecture, local coupling (active and passive) between filaments and filament recycling.  We proceeded in three steps:  First, we analyze the passive deformation of a network in response to a constant external force.  We determine the timescales on which fluidlike deformation occurs as a function of network architecture and filament recycling times.  Next, we considered the active case and made similar measurements of the timescales of internal stress buildup and dissipation. Finally, we were able to synthesize our understanding of the passive and active systems to analyze the behavior of a more complex situation of an actively flowing network.


% PASSIVE SECTION
\subsection*{Filament recycling prevents cortical tearing and modulates the viscous stress relaxation of passive filament networks}
 
% Example of passive simulation measurements
\paragraph{Networks with passive cross-links and no filament turnover undergo three stages of deformation in response to an extensional force.} 
To characterize the passive response of a filament network with efective crosslink drag in the absence of filament recycling and motor activity, we imposed an external force on a simulated network of height H = xxx microns and length L , and then quantified network deformation and internal network stress as a function of time. We measured the local velocity of the network at different positions 0 <= x <= L along the axis of deformation as the mean velocity of all filament segments intersecting that position;  We measured the internal network stress at each position by summing the axial component of the tensions on all filament segments intersecting that position, and dividing by network height;  finally, we measured network strain as the change in network length divided by the original length

Brief initial description of deformation:  In response to applied stress the network deforms continuoiusly  During intermediate stages of the deformation, the stress profile (blue) is nearly constant throughout the material while the velocity profile (orange) is linear in space.  This justifies a materioal description in terms of bulk quantities (material stress, strain rate, effective viscosity, etc)Plotting the material stress and strain rates as function of time revealed that the  deformation occurred in three qualitatively distinct phases (Figure 2a,c). On short timescales the network exhibited a rapid viscoelastic response, characterized by a rapid buildup of internal stress and a rapid ~exponential approach to a fixed strain similar to that predicted by [Head et al., 2003]. On intermediate timescales, the internal stress remained constant while the network continued to deformslowly and continuously with ~constant strain rate as filaments slipped past one another against the effective drag. This linear relationship between strain and time characterizes a material with an effective viscosity, given by the ratio of the applied stress to the strain rate.  We define the transition time between this fast, viscoelastic response and the slower, effectively viscous deformation phase as ($\tau_c$).  Finally, on long timescales, this effectively viscous behavior broke down.  As the network strain approached a critical value (~ 30\% for the simulation in Figure 2), strain thinning lead to decreased network connectivity, local tearing, and acceleration of the network deformation (see inset in Figure 2c) .; This eventually resulted in the highly heterogeneous network structure shown in the t=440 example of Figure 2a. 


We first probed the network's passive response by imposing an external force on our simulated network in the absence of recycling.   As shown in Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}.a, by applying a force at the boundary of a patch of network, we induced a rightward deformation or strain, $\gamma$, equal to the change in patch size divided by the original size, ($\gamma=\Delta x/x_0$).  The deformation occurred in three phases corresponding to the three example networks in Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}.a.  On short timescales the networked quickly responded by elastically approaching a fixed strain $\gamma_0$, similar to that predicted by \cite{theo_hlm}.  On longer timescales, we found that the network continued deforming more slowly as filaments were able to slip past each other.  Finally, as the network continued to dilate viscously, the connectivity of the network decreased.  Eventually connected patches became isolated and the network teared, resulting in the highly heterogeneous network structure shown in the t=440 example of Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}.a.  


We next analyzed the force and velocity data of the network at individual time points to determine what kind of deformation the material was undergoing.  As shown by the data in Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}.b corresponding to the simulation at time t=88s, during this stage, the stress profile (blue) is nearly constant throughout the material while the velocity profile (orange) is linear in space.  These are two indications that a purely viscous description is adequate for this stage of deformation.  By measuring the mean material stress and strain rate ($\overline{v_i/x_i}$) at every time point, we generated a measurement of the material strain through time as shown in Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}.c.  From this measurement, we can identify phases of deformation outlined in Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}.a.  It's clear that there are two phases in the stress and strain profile: one characterized by a rapid buildup of internal stress and strain, and one where the internal stress remains constant and the strain increases more slowly.  We define the transition time between this fast, elastic response and the slower, viscous response as $\tau_c$. For times longer than $\tau_c$ the material underwent a steady continuous straining at a nearly constant rate.  This linear relationship between strain and time characterizes a material with an effective viscosity, $\eta$, given by the ratio of the applied stress to the strain rate (i.e $\sigma/\dot{\gamma}$).  At very long times, this constant strain rate behavior begins to break down.   As the network strains beyond 30\% or so, network connectivity decreases, and the strain rate of the network begins to increase.  This strain thinning behavior can be seen in the hockey-stick shape of the inset of Figure \ref{fig:passive_ex}.c.

% Viscosity and timescale parameter dependence
\paragraph{Network architecture sets the rate and timescales of deformation.}  To better understand the origins of effective viscosity and the timescale for transition to viscous behavior and the effective viscosity, we systematically varied network parameters and applied stress and measured effective viscosity and the transition time ($\tau_c$). For the entire range of network parameters that we sampled, we observed a transition from a fast viscoelastic response to slow effectively viscous deformation. A simple theoretical analysis predicted that the effective viscosity should be proportional to the square of the crosslink density and the effective crosslink drag coefficient of the individual cross-links, with a constant of proportionality $\pi/4$. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:passive_form}.a, our simulations agree well with the theory for a large range of network parameters. For many simple viscoelastic materials, the ratio of the elastic modulus, $G_0$, to the viscosity $\eta_c$, is a general indicator of the transition timescale from elastic to viscous behavior (need a reference). Using the approximation of the equation for elastic modulus from \cite{theo_hlm}, $G_0 \approx \mu/l_c$, we predict a crossover time, $\tau_c \approx L^2\xi/l_c\mu$. By measuring the time at which the strain rate became nearly constant we obtained an estimate of this time for a wide variety of simulation parameters. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:passive_form}.b, our approximation is in good agreement with the observed transition time. These data confirm that our model is consistent with previous models for the viscoelastic response of semi flexible polymer networks.

\end{figure}


% Passive Recycling
\paragraph{Filament recycling rescues network tearing and modulates effective viscosity.}  We next explored how the passive network response to an applied force changed in the presence of filament recycling. To do so we ran a series of simulations with identical filament lengths and network densities and filament slip rates, while varying the rate at which filaments were reset to a refreshed, unstressed state. Increasing  filament recycling rates produced two  striking changes in the long time response of the network.. First, increasing recycling rates could prevent strain thinning, network tearing and acceleration of network strain rates observed in the absence of recycling. As an example,  for the network shown in Figure \ref{fig:passive_rec}.a, strain thinning and network tearing  lead to a rapid increase in strain rate above a critical strain of $\sim40\%$. In contrast, when filaments are made to recycle with an average lifetime of 10 s, the same network, in response to the same level of applied stress, can sustain effectively viscous deformation, at a much higher strain rate (i.e. a much lower effective viscosity), for an indefinite period of time.  Plotting effective viscosity as a function of decreasing recycling times revealed sharp decrease in effective viscosity as the recycling time approached $\tau_c$, the characteristic time for transition to viscous deformation.  

An intuitive explanation of this effect is that rapid recycling increases the network?s ability to sustain the faster deformation rate that occurs during the initial viscoelastic response to applied stress. By constantly turning over strained network elements and replacing them with unstrained filaments , the network is able to dissipate stored elastic stress to maintain itself indefinitely within the viscoelastic response regime.  


To test if this is a general relationship, we plotted the normalized effective viscosity (ratio of effective viscosity with recycling to effective viscosity without recycling, $\eta_c$) vs a normalized recycling rate (recycling time scaled by $\tau_c$) for a large range of different network parameters and filament recycling times (Figure \ref{fig:rec_form}). Indeed, for a large range of network parameters, the normalized effective viscosity begins to decrease when the recycling time falls below $\tau_c$ and below this value the effective viscosity falls off linearly with recycling time.

\end{figure}

%Discuss
Taken together, our results for the passive network under extension suggest that the passive stress relaxation of our network model is modified strongly by the presence of filament recycling. Given high enough levels of recycling, we find that network tearing can be prevented and that a steady state effective viscosity is established. Our model also suggests a simple microscopic derivation of viscosity which depends on the strength of inter filament cross-linking, the networks architecture, and the timescale of filament recycling.








% ACTIVE SECTION
\subsection*{Filament recycling allows persistent stress buildup in active networks}

\paragraph{In the absence of filament recycling, active networks with free boundaries contract and then stall against passive resistance to network compression.}


We found that our simulation axioms were able to produce transient contraction of a patch of free-floating network.  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:active_con}.a, when an intitially unstrained network has internal motor activity "switched on" at $t=0$, the .  By 100 s, the network has contracted by 40\%, and many internal filaments can be seen to have reached a compressed state (indicated by orange).  By 150 s, the compression has stalled, but filament sliding has begun to force some filaments away from the center. Over long time periods, this filament sorting actually rearranges the entire network, undoing the initial contraction (see supplemental video).

By monitoring both the network and individual filament strains, as in Figure \ref{fig:active_con}.b, we see that the networks macroscopic deformation can be explained entirely by a buildup of internal compression on individual filaments.  Due to the strong stiffness assymetry, there is far more compressive strain than there is extension in the network. It is this asymmetry that generates the net contraction in a disordered network despite myosin activity being equally capable of generating both.  The network contraction stalled over the same timescale as individual filaments, further indicating the essential role of filament compression in generating contractility.  

The final contraction extent was strongly dependent on the magnitudes of both the filament stiffness asymmetry (i.e. the ratio of the extensional and compressive stiffnesses $\mu_e/\mu_c$) and the motor activity scale ($\upsilon$).  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:active_con}.c, small stiffness asymmetries lead to less overall contraction, while larger asymmetries appear to reach asymptotic once they reach a ratio of $\sim 100$.  Additionally, contraction would only occur when there was fractional motor activity, $0<\phi<1$, (see supplement).  Finally, we found that the contraction consistently stalled over a time scale, $\tau_m=$ (see supplement), indicating that the network architecture also plays a role in setting the timescale of contraction.  These findings of the minimal requirements for contractility are all in direct accordance with the theoretical predictions of \cite{1367-2630-14-3-033037} and \cite{PhysRevX.4.041002}.  In fact, we find that removing any single factor from this simulation framework leads to a loss of contraction, suggesting that this system may represent a minimal model of contractility.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Active networks can only exert a transient force against a fixed boundary in the absence of filament recycling.}

Due to the complication of making measurements in the presence of such large-scale rearrangements of the network, we decided to additionally analyzed the stress buildup in a patch that was constrained to maintain its original area.  The results from Figure \ref{fig:active_str}.a echo those from Figure \ref{fig:active_con}.a, with a consistent buildup of internal filament strain (represented by the colored lines) that stabilizes and persists indefinitely.  However, in contrast the network in Figure \ref{fig:active_str}.a doesn't demonstrate any apparent large-scale rearrangement as any net deformation is impossible since the patch sets in a domain with periodic boundaries.

Under these conditions, we found that a net stress was generated throughout the material, but that the net stress could not be maintained .and would decay after  characteristic time.  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:active_str}.b, the results showed a period of net stress due to an imbalance between larger stresses from extended filaments and smaller stresses from compressed filaments.  After a characteristic timescale $\tau_a$, the extensional stress peaks and begins to decrease while the compressive stresses continue to build up resulting in the extensional and compressive stresses beginning to cancel each other.  After this peak, the internal stresses become balanced and the net stress drops to approximately 0.  Finally, we measured the time of peak stress and found it consistently occurred with a characteristic time, $\tau_a=\xi/l_c\sqrt{\mu\upsilon}$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:active_str}.c.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Filament recycling allows network to exert sustained stress on a fixed boundary.}
We next added filament recycling to the simulation setup with and found that the presence of recycling allowed for persistent.  Similar to the mechanism for preserving integrity in passive networks, the recycling appears to refresh the network such that subsets of filaments are continually transitioning from an unstressed to their stressed state before being recycled back to the unstressed state.  The presence of recycling therefore both repaired structural inhomogeneities and reset the net strain of individual filaments. The panels in \ref{fig:active_rec}.a show the differences in structure for identical starting architectures in the presence of different recycling timescales.  Clearly, longer recycling times allow the network to reach a more strongly reorganized and internally stressed network.

Upon the addition of filament recycling, we found that the network maintained a nonzero net stress for timescales much longer than $\tau_a$.  We refer to this as the steady state stress because, based on our simulations, it doesn't appear that this stress ever subsides.   As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:active_rec}.b, The profile of stress buildup changes dramatically by changing the recycling timescale in identical networks corresponding to those in Figure \ref{fig:active_rec}.a.  It's important to notice that the effect of changing recycling time is not an entirely simple dependence.  As the recycling time is decreased from 333 to 33.3, we can see that the long-term steady state increases from nearly 0.05 to a closer to 0.15.  Nevertheless, the final steady state is still lower than the peak stress for those curves.  In contrast, for the faster recycling rates (3.33, 0.33, 0.033), the final steady state decreases monotonically with decreasing recycling time.  In addition, for these shorter timescales, the stress never reaches a peak but rather rises immediately to its steady state level.  We attribute this to the strain resetting whereby individual filaments repeatedly are set to an unstrained state and then transition too having more strain until they are again reset.

Note that significant remodeling occurs for longer recycling times.  \textbf{b)} Plots of net stress for different recycling times; for long-lived filaments, stress is built rapidly, but then dissipates.  Increasing filament turnover rates reduces stress dissipation by recycling compressed filaments; however, very short recycling times prevent any stress from being built up in the first place. }

\subsection*{Filament recycling tunes the balance between active stress buildup and viscous stress relaxation}


we found that the steady state stress was well predicted by the comparison between the timescale of recycling, $\tau_r$ and that of peak activity, $\tau_a$.

The steady state stress is set by the timescale at which the network strain is refreshed relative to the timescale at which the max stress is reached. }
